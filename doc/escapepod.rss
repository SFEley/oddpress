Rated R. Contains sex and violence.

<p><i>He didn&#8217;t call himself The Aerialist at first. The newspapers came up with that later. He called himself Kid Kangaroo of all things, because of the jumping from rooftop to rooftop, even though I made fun of him, called him &#8220;Joey,&#8221; made jokes about dingoes. Nobody knows his secret identity but me, and I only found out because I snuck into the treehouse one night to smoke a cigarette and found him changing out of his leotard and tights and domino mask. He was only fifteen. I still remember what he said: &#8220;Don&#8217;t tell anyone &#8212; if my identity is discovered, you and mom and dad could be used against me.&#8221; </i></p>

He spent most of that first day walking up and down the Champs Elyseacute;es, working the stiffness out of his bones and muscles while he looked at the shops and the people.  Some of the dull ache was from the wooden benches on the train from Hamburg; most of it was age.  And beneath the discomfort of his body, his soul ached too.

He'd never been here before, he thought as the Parisians slipped past in the noon-time sun.  He snorted at the revelation.  A fine painter you are, he told himself.

<p><i>I suck in my chest and tighten the buckles before getting lightheaded.

<p><i>Since the above may seem somewhat harsh, let me say what I can to mitigate it.

You have told us that with his dying breath Professor Steinhardt handed you his notebook and said, &#8220;Have this published in Review of Physics.&#8221; Such an action would be completely in character for Steinhardt since he was a true scientist.</i></p>

<p><i>As for your claim that Professor Steinhardt made this statement as he was expiring from disintegrator rays wounds suffered during your escape from the City of Disembodied Brains on Altair IV, our believing that is a somewhat different matter but we need to go into that. </i></p>

<p><b>Statement from Rachel Swirsky:</b><br/>
Richard K. Lyon died on November 21. When I contacted him last month to ask if he still wanted this piece to run on our podcast, he said that the doctors didn&#8217;t give him long, but that he hoped this would give the world &#8220;one last laugh.&#8221;</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Folks:</p>

<p>Summary first.  Escape Pod is going to miss its weekly releases for the remainder of November.  We will resume in December, probably the first week.</p>

<p>Now the explanation.
<span id="more-321"></span></p>

<p>I suppose I could just say that I&#8217;m writing this just prior to leaving for my grandmother&#8217;s funeral.  She died a few weeks ago, and the memorial service is taking place in New Jersey this weekend.  That would be sufficient excuse to miss a week by almost anyone&#8217;s reckoning.  Add in a tough new day job,  lingering physical illness, and unstable brain chemistry, and I could really play for some sympathy here.  But it isn&#8217;t the complete picture.</p>

<p>The fact is that I need some time.  I need to get regrounded, for my own health and also for the good of Escape Pod.  Since May of 2005 we have not missed a week, and I&#8217;ve been very proud &#8212; perhaps hubristic &#8212; of having one of the longest uninterrupted runs in podcasting.  We&#8217;ve achieved some amazing things almost by accident: we&#8217;ve become the number two SF market with about 25,000 listeners, we&#8217;ve brought attention to incredible stories by previously unknown authors, and we&#8217;ve grown into a real business with two additional podcasts.  From a strategic point of view we&#8217;re doing all right.  We&#8217;re not totally where I wanted to be by now, but fundamentally we&#8217;re succeeding.</p>

<p>But tactically, with Escape Pod in particular, I&#8217;ve been flying way too close to the ground.  It&#8217;s been week-to-week and barely controlled chaos for a really long time now.  My communication&#8217;s always been behind, but now it&#8217;s by months.  The releases keep slipping, and sometimes I don&#8217;t know on Monday what the week&#8217;s story will be.  It&#8217;s been costing me more sleep than usual.  These are resolvable issues; I have a nice clear to-do list of obvious things that would make my job a lot easier.  (&#8221;Better delegation&#8221; covers about half the list.)  But I haven&#8217;t been stepping back to do any of them.  Even when I have the time, it&#8217;s been hard to muster the energy.</p>

<p>Most of all, I&#8217;m afraid of losing my perspective.  For a while now I&#8217;ve been pushing myself so hard on EP that it&#8217;s close to becoming more Not Fun than Fun.  I&#8217;m in danger of forgetting why I&#8217;m doing it.  And <i>that</i> is not something I can permit.  If I lose my own passion for the stories, I know I won&#8217;t be the only one who suffers.  That&#8217;s the point at which the podcast will start to suck.</p>

<p>So I&#8217;m doing a very, <i>very</i> difficult thing right now for the sake of long-term success: I&#8217;m letting myself fail for a few weeks.  I&#8217;m taking a breather, relaxing a bit, and trying to forgive myself for doing it.  I&#8217;m going to do right by my grandmother, and then I&#8217;m going to take a few days to just chill, and <i>then</i> I&#8217;m going to see what I need to do to get organized and get on top of the game again.</p>

<p>I know it&#8217;s risky to pin such things to a schedule.  But I&#8217;m pretty confident in the range of this hiatus: it will not be less than two weeks, and it should not be more than four.  The smart money&#8217;s on three weeks, putting us back on in the first week of December.  We already have some great stuff pending.  We have the next Union Dues story, and in my opinion it&#8217;s the best one yet.  We have a fantastic alien world story from this year&#8217;s Cambpell Award winner, Mary Robinette Kowal.  And Mur Lafferty is preparing what may be the most kickass science fiction Christmas story ever.  I promise you we&#8217;ll be back soon, because dammit, <b><i>I</i></b> want to hear those things in audio.</p>

<p>Two logistical points:</p>

<p>First, <a href="http://podcastle.org">PodCastle</a> and <a href="http://pseudopod.org">Pseudopod</a> aren&#8217;t affected.  Rachel and Ann and Ben and Al are totally in the groove, and Escape Artists as a company is doing fine.  This announcement only affects Escape Pod.  So you&#8217;ve still got a short fiction fix, and if those aren&#8217;t enough, feel free to <a href="http://drabblecast.org">check</a> <a href="http://clonepod.org">out</a> <a href="http://dunesteef.com">some</a> <a href="http://welltoldtales.com">others</a>.</p>

<p>Second, I&#8217;m well aware that donors have a pretty good reason to be upset.  You&#8217;re giving your money on an article of faith, after all &#8212; that we&#8217;ll use it to keep bringing you stories &#8212; and if we&#8217;re not bringing them to you, even temporarily, we&#8217;re not keeping that trust.  We&#8217;ve recently had some <i>very</i> substantial donations, ones which I have yet to send proper thank-you messages for.  (Those are coming too.)  I&#8217;m hoping most of you will be cool with my reasoning here and bear with us.  But if you&#8217;ve donated in the past few months and you object to this hiatus, e-mail me from your PayPal address and let me know, and I will refund your money to you, no questions asked.  I would honestly rather keep your goodwill than your cash.</p>

<p>&#8230;So there you have it.  That&#8217;s the honest explanation of what&#8217;s going on, as best I can state it.  I&#8217;ll be spending the next few weeks gathering my wits, my priorities, and a team, probably in that order.  And then you&#8217;ll have more stories.  We&#8217;ll be back soon.  In the meantime, thank you for any patience you&#8217;re willing to give.</p>

<p>And of course: Have Fun.</p>

<p><i>&#8220;I must tell you, then, that I am an old man, a very old man.&#8221; He paused momentarily. &#8220;And it happens that I have money that I must presently be leaving, and never a child have I to leave it to.&#8221; I thought of the confidence trick, and resolved I would be on the alert for the vestiges of my five hundred pounds. He proceeded to enlarge on his loneliness, and the trouble he had to find a proper disposition of his money. &#8220;I have weighed this plan and that plan, charities, institutions, and scholarships, and libraries, and I have come to this conclusion at last,&#8221;&#8211;he fixed his eyes on my face,&#8211;&#8221;that I will find some young fellow, ambitious, pure-minded, and poor, healthy in body and healthy in mind, and, in short, make him my heir, give him all that I have.&#8221; He repeated, &#8220;Give him all that I have. So that he will suddenly be lifted out of all the trouble and struggle in which his sympathies have been educated, to freedom and influence.&#8221;</i></p>

<p><i>I tried to seem disinterested. With a transparent hypocrisy I said, &#8220;And you want my help, my professional services maybe, to find that person.&#8221;</i></p>

The man opened the pack all the way to reveal a small arsenal of guns, grenades, explosives, and -- oddly -- knives. Very large knives. He looked up at Stanuel. "I am the attack. I've been asked to shut Pan down."

"But you're not a programmer..."

"I can do all things through explosives, who destroy for me." The man began moving the contents of the pack inside the pockets and straps of the trenchcoat, clipped more to his belt and thigh, as well as to holsters under each arm, and then added pieces to his ankles.

He was now a walking arsenal.

But only half the pack had been emptied. The mysterious mercenary tossed it at Stanuel. "Besides, you're going to help."

Rated PG.  Contains violence and political revolution.

<p><i>King spots a knock-off cluster, glowing sunny in the rain, too fit, perfectly proportioned. Tear off some burnished bronze, never-burning skin. Shove it under a microscope, see the designer signature, Chinese characters like tattoos on the necks of college girls.</i></p>

<p><i>All ten ranked cross-country runners this season took family trips to China after school let out last year. When they&#8217;d returned and established dominance, King took the Asics guy up on his offer to join the experimental training program. Found himself running by himself, following daily instructions from an email address. King knows there&#8217;s a machine on the other end, some oracle in some data center chewing on his performance data full time. Responds only to email, immediately, all hours.</i></p>

<p><b>Rated R</b>.  Contains strong language, strong emotions, and moderate violence.</p>

King spots a knock-off cluster, glowing sunny in the rain, too fit, perfectly proportioned. Tear off some burnished bronze, never-burning skin. Shove it under a microscope, see the designer signature, Chinese characters like tattoos on the necks of college girls.

All ten ranked cross-country runners this season took family trips to China after school let out last year. When they'd returned and established dominance, King took the Asics guy up on his offer to join the experimental training program. Found himself running by himself, following daily instructions from an email address. King knows there's a machine on the other end, some oracle in some data center chewing on his performance data full time. Responds only to email, immediately, all hours.

Rated R.  Contains strong language, strong emotions, and moderate violence.

<p><em>Humans laid the foundation for the sixth apocalypse in much the same way they&#8217;d triggered the previous ones. Having recovered their ambition after the Apocalypse of Serotonin and rebuilt their populations after the Apocalypse of Grease, they once again embarked on their species&#8217; long term goal to wreak as much havoc as possible on the environment through carelessness and boredom. This time, the trees protested. They devoured buildings, whipped wind into hurricanes between their branches, tangled men into their roots and devoured them as mulch. In retaliation, men chopped down trees, fire-bombed jungles, and released genetically engineered insects to devour tender shoots.

<p><em>The pitched battle decimated civilians on both sides, but eventually &#8212; though infested and rootless &#8212; the trees overwhelmed their opposition. Mankind was forced to send its battered representatives to a sacred grove in the middle of the worldâs oldest forest and beg for a treaty.

The pitched battle decimated civilians on both sides, but eventually -- though infested and rootless -- the trees overwhelmed their opposition. Mankind was forced to send its battered representatives to a sacred grove in the middle of the worldrsquo;s oldest forest and beg for a treaty.


Rated PG.  Contains war, invasion, exodus, mass extinction, religious revival, and a lot of mud.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve been in e-mail contact today with Jeffrey DeRego&#8217;s wife Cindy.  She tells me that he had open heart surgery yesterday to bypass five blocked arteries.  The surgery was successful and he&#8217;s expected to go home sometime next week.</p>

<p>If anyone cares to know for purposes of sending cards or flowers, etc., he&#8217;s at the Catholic Medical Center in Manchester, New Hampshire.  You&#8217;re also welcome to send cards via us (<b>Jeffrey DeRego, c/o Escape Artists Inc., PO Box 1538, Stone Mountain GA  30086</b>) and I&#8217;ll see that they get forwarded to him.</p>

<p>I asked if any financial assistance would be useful, and without getting into overly personal details, the answer is &#8220;yes.&#8221;  The DeRegos aren&#8217;t in a good position right now in terms of employment, and while they&#8217;re applying for state assistance, surgery of this magnitude is still certain to have a very harsh impact.  Escape Artists will be making a contribution, and with Cindy&#8217;s permission, I&#8217;m asking the Escape Pod listenership to help out.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve set up a PayPal address just for this purpose under our corporate account.  If you&#8217;d like to help Jeff out, please send your contributions via PayPal to <b>derego@escapepod.org</b>.  (I hope to have a better link on the sidebar by tonight.)  We&#8217;ll cover PayPal fees, so 100% of funds donated will go to defray Jeff&#8217;s and Cindy&#8217;s medical expenses.  I&#8217;ll keep that PayPal address open through September.</p>

<p>Please follow your conscience on whether to help.  Jeff&#8217;s given us some of our favorite EP stories, and I&#8217;m happy to do whatever I can for him.  If you see fit to help him out too, I&#8217;m sure he and his wife would be very grateful.  Thanks for your attention.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>First: my apologies for recent delays in getting Escape Pod out; in the last couple of weeks it&#8217;s hit the feed Friday afternoons rather than late Thursday.  It&#8217;s <em>probably</em> going to happen again this week.  Personal business lately has included me losing my day job, finding a new and much better day job in the space of a couple of weeks (I start Tuesday), and taking on some short-term obligations to fill in the gaps.  Expect more on that in an upcoming metacast In the meantime I&#8217;m realizing I&#8217;m having to get <em>much</em> better organized with a lot of Escape Artists work, not for efficiency but for necessity.  So yes, things are late; but I still don&#8217;t expect to miss any weeks, and I hope that the lateness will be short term.</p>

<p>Now to the news: once again, Escape Pod and Minx&#8217;s <a href="http://polyweekly.com">Polyamory Weekly</a> will be hosting a joint meetup at Dragon*Con.  Just like last year, we&#8217;ll be doing a group brunch on <b>SUNDAY, AUGUST 31 AT 11:30 AM</b>, at the <a href="http://gordonbiersch.com/restaurants/index.php?pg=location&#038;sub=loc&#038;location_id=28">Gordon Biersch Brewpub</a>.  It&#8217;s about a mile north from the hotels, but an easy walk or cab ride.  This time we have the restaurant&#8217;s upper mezzanine reserved, so it&#8217;s like having the place to ourselves.  Ask at the front for the Escape Pod meetup.</p>

<p>Generally, I expect to hit very little programming at this year&#8217;s D*C.  My intent for almost the entire con is just to hang out at the bars or parties, and socialize and relax.  If you&#8217;d like to join me, follow my <a href="http://twitter.com/SFEley">Twitter feed</a> to find out where I am or <a href="mailto:sfeley@gmail.com">drop me a line</a> to met me know where you are.  And if you know where the <i>good</i> parties are &#8212; let me know too!</p>

<p>Thanks, and we&#8217;ll have the next EP up as soon as possible.  (It&#8217;s a Union Dues story, if that helps with the waiting.)</p>
